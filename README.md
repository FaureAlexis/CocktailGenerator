# CocktailGenerator
1st IOS app project : random cocktail generator. To learn swift as part of an EPITECH Experience

## App code
Code is located in the [ViewController.swift](https://github.com/FaureAlexis/CocktailGenerator/blob/38cad4e7e688b23a96e799eee2b0cfdbec9f7d88/Teki/ViewController.swift)

I have experimented simple code like data structures, arrays, control structures (conditions) and UI interactions.
